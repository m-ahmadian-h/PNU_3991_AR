In this section, we will briefly review my performance in relation to the undergraduate project course.
In the undergraduate project course, I tried to put into practice what I had learned most during my undergraduate course and show it to Professor Razavi. My project is about the relationship between artificial intelligence and the largest capital market (forex). I tried to use artificial intelligence to slightly increase the chances of predicting the forex.
In the end, I am very grateful to Master Razavi for all his help to me, which made me progress tens of steps in relation to what I have learned.
