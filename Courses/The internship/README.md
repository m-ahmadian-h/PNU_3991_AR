In this section, we will briefly review my performance in relation to the The internship course.
In my internship, I first entered the real work environment and work community and then gained some experience. Finally, I implemented a practical project to showcase my achievements during this internship.
In the end, I am very grateful to Master Razavi for all his help to me, which made me progress tens of steps in relation to what I have learned.
